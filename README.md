# PubNub demo using Twitter Streaming API - frontend

This is the frontend part of the PubNub demo application which gets live tweets from the
Twitter Streaming API and publishes them using the PubNub Java API.  
This Angular application receives the Tweets via [PubNub](https://www.pubnub.com/) and displays them to the user in real time.  
  
Source code repository for the backend: [TwitterStreamingPubNubDemoBackend](https://github.com/VictorGil/TwitterStreamingPubNubDemoBackend).
